## Installation

```
yarn add react react-dom react-range
```

## End to end testing

**This library is tightly coupled to many DOM APIs**. It would be very hard to write unit tests that would not involve a lot of mocking. Or we could re-architect the library to better abstract all DOM interfaces but that would mean more code and bigger footprint.

Instead of that, `react-range` is thoroughly tested by end to end tests powered by [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). It tests all user interactions:

All tests are automatically ran in Travis CI with headless chromium. This way, the public API is well tested, including pixel-perfect positioning. Also, the tests are pretty fast, reliable and very descriptive.

Do you want to run them in the `dev` mode (slows down operations, opens the browser)?

```bash
yarn storybook #start the storybook server
yarn test:e2e:dev #run the e2e tests
```

`CI` mode (storybook started on the background, quick, headless)

```bash
yarn test:e2e
```
